OrganizationType provides a controlled vocabulary of organisational classifications, such as "Headquarters", "Regional Headquarters", or "Branch". Maintaining a separate entity for organisation types rather than free-text values ensures consistency across the dataset and enables structured filtering and aggregation in reporting. The type classification is relevant for determining applicable regulatory obligations, disclosure requirements, and boundary-setting methodologies. Each OrganizationType may apply to many organisations simultaneously.

## Attributes

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| id | Key |  | The unique system-assigned identifier for the OrganizationType record. It is the primary key used when associating an Organization with its type classification. It must be stable and not recycled once assigned. |
| name | String |  | The descriptive label for the organisation type, such as "Headquarters", "Regional Headquarters", or "Branch". The name should be drawn from a recognised taxonomy to ensure comparability across organisations and should be rendered consistently in all user-facing interfaces and reports. |
